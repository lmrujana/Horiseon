# Horiseon

## Objective
To refactor an existing code, making it more readable, accesible and SEO friendly.

## Starting code
The starting code did not use many descriptive tags, most of them where &lt;div&gt;s with different classes and IDs. Also, there were some broken links and no spacing between sections. Inside the CCS file, same styling was used in more than one declaration, making it unnecessarly long.

## Final Code
The final code is much more organized, it uses semantic tags such as &lt;header&gt; and &lt;main&gt;. Broken links were also fixed and alt attributes were added to all images. In the CSS file, rules that repeated the same styling were deleted and grouped into single blocks of code, that were then used to style all the elements that had that same styling.
