# Horiseon

## Objective
To refactor an existing code, making it more readable, accesible and SEO friendly.

## Starting code
The starting code did not use many descriptive tags, most of them where &gt;div&lt;s with different classes and IDs. Also, there were some broken links and no spacing between sections. Inside the CCS file, same styling was used in more than one declaration, making it unnecessarly long.
